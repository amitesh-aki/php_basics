Document Overview

Python equivalent in PHP:

Comment:
# is //

''' is /*
'''    */

Print:
print() is echo"";

New LIne:
\n is <br> for new line. To execute it write it as:
<?php
echo "<br>";
?>

Variables:
variables are prefixed with a dollar sign($).

Constant:
define("constant_name",value_for_our_constant); 
tells php that we are declaring our constant

echo "our_constant: " . constant_name;
will print contant_name as our_constant: value_for_our_constant

Value of constant cannot be changed later in our code. Doing so will gegenrate en error.
Unlike variables, a constant need not be use a $ sign before declaring it. 

String:
Same as python. "" or ''. However, while declaring a variable, it is better to use double quotations because sinle quotes may give out the variable text itself and not the value inside the variable.

^ is pow()

% is fmod()

Like Python, array indexes start at 0
